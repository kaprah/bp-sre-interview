Python script that can be run to loop through and print out the values of a dictionary with their corresponding values of the key bucketname.

* Set AWS credentials through AWS CLI using AWS Configure
* Created a S3 List objects function and S3 Get objects
    * Knew the initial S3 bucket and Key, but did not know the contents of the new S3 buckets
    * Would add a new TODO to better account for listing the objects out of the S3 buckets. After learning they all had the same name checked against that, but would want a more usable solution going forward
